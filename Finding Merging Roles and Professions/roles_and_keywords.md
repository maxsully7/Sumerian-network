# Roles and Keywords in Drehem Texts

The Drehem texts use keywords to indicate "source", "recipient", "intermediary" etc. Here is an overview of such expressions.

| expression | translation | role | example | comments |
|----------- | ----------- |------|---------|----------|
| ki PN-ta   | from PN     | source | ki lu₂-dingir-ra-ta | the final -ta is not part of the name |
| PN i₃-dab₅ | PN took     | recipient | puzur₄-i₃-li₂ i₃-dab₅ | transfer from one office to another|
| mu-kuₓ(DU) (PN) | delivery (to PN) | new owner | mu-kuₓ(DU) ṣe-lu-uš-{d}da-gan       | after commodities that enter the administration |
| PN šu ba-ti; PN šu ba-an-ti  | PN received | recipient | {d}šul-gi-i₃-li₃ šu ba-ti |  |
| ŋiri₃ PN | via PN | intermediary | ŋiri₃ lu₂-giri₁₇-zal | person who brings animals from source to recipient |
| PN maškim | PN is the royal representative | representative | ARAD₂-mu maškim | person giving gifts as representative of the king |
| ki PN-ta ba-zi | expended by PN | source | ki ab-ba-kal-la-ta ba-zi | commodities leaving the administration |
| zi-ga PN | expenditure of PN | source | zi-ga {d}šul-gi-i₃-li₂ | commodities leaving the administration |

Remarks: 

**mu-kuₓ(DU)** may be followed by **lugal** (king) or by a name (always a member of the royal family or someone very high up). This means: delivery to the king/PN. There may still be a "recipient", that is: the person who actually takes care of the animals/commodities. 

A name may be followed by a professional title such as scribe (**dub-sar**), cup-bearer (**sagi**), etc. A name may also be followed by the remark "son of PN" (**dumu** PN), or some other family relationship.

# How keywords are represented in the current Data set

In the current data set we do not have the raw text, but rather the lemmatization. In the lemmatization, the lemma (dictionary form of the word) is followed by square brackets. Between the square brackets you get a rough translation of the word, after the square brackets the Part Of Speech (or POS). Example: udu[sheep]N. Lemmatization may use unusual characters such as š (sh-sound) or ŋ (nasal g).

| PN-ta                   | example: ur-{d}en-lil₂-la₂-**ta**[]PN | the element **-ta** should come immediate before the opening square bracket and after the square brackets you get 'PN' |
