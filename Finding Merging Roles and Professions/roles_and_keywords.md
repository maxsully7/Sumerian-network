The Drehem texts use keywords to indicate "source", "recipient", "intermediary" etc. Here is an overview of such expressions.

| expression | translation | role | example | comments |

Remarks: 

**mu-kuₓ(DU)** may be followed by **lugal** (king) or by a name (always a member of the royal family or someone very high up). This means: delivery to the king/PN. There may still be a "recipient", that is: the person who actually takes care of the animals/commodities. 

A name may be followed by a professional title such as scribe (**dub-sar**), cup-bearer (**sagi**), etc. A name may also be followed by the remark "son of PN" (**dumu** PN).
