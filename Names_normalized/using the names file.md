# Using the Names File

The Names file contains names in transliteration (in the form Ab-ba-mu-ce3) and normalized (form Abbaŋu[]PN). The normalized form differs in some respects from the transliterated form.

- all endings (morphology) removed (Ab-ba-mu-ce3 and Ab-ba-mu-ta are both normalized as Abbaŋu[]PN)
- normalized form includes special characters such as ŋ and š (where transliteration would use c and j).
- different spellings of the same name get the same normalized form:  

```
4393	U2-ta-Mi-car-ra-am-ta		Utamišaram[]PN
4394	U2-ta-mi-car-ra-am		Utamišaram[]PN
4395	U2-ta-mi-car-ra-am-ta		Utamišaram[]PN
4396	U2-ta-mi-car-ru-um		Utamišarum[]PN
4397	U2-ta1-mi-car-ra-am-ta		Utamišaram[]PN			typo
4398	U2-ta2-Mi-car-ra-am		Utamišaram[]PN
4399	U2-ta2-Mi-car-ra-am-ta		Utamišaram[]PN
```

The transliterated form also differs in some respects from the ORACC transliterations: 

- all transliterated names in the Names file begin with a capital (Ab-ba-mu-ce3 vs. ab-ba-mu-še₃).
- Names file uses c and j where ORACC uses š and ŋ
- Sign index numbers are written on the line in the Names file, but ORACC uses unicode subscripts (Ab-ba-mu-ce3 vs. ab-ba-mu-še₃)

Some "names" are marked as "No PN". Those are to be ignored.

In addition to PN, there is also SN (Settlement Name); DN (Deity Name); and RN (Royal Name).
