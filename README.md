# Sumerian-network
Using data from [ORACC](http://build-oracc.museum.upenn.edu/epsd2/u3adm), build a social network analysis graph.

Tasks: find names, titles, roles, transaction types. Create a social network graph in [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) and analyze the graph.

We will concentrate on documents from Puzri≈°-Dagan (also known as Drehem). There are approximately 15,000 such texts. In order to find the metadata use [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu). [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) uses text IDs (six-digit P numbers) which are also used by [ORACC](http://oracc.org). You can download the entire [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) database.
